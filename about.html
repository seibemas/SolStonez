						<p>
							My name is <strong><em>Mason</em></strong>, and I am the man behind the mirror that is creating these meaningful wrapped and weaved works of art!<br><br> 

							<em>My journey began</em> when I was in my teens and I developed an interest for holistic health, <a href="healing-stones.html">stones</a>, meditation, and the energy of our Human bodies! I started collecting, researching, and using crystals when I was <strong>16</strong>. I was fascinated by their looks, and the subtle energy you can feel coming from them!<br><br>

							As time went on, I learned more about the <strong>Human energy field</strong>, also know as an <strong><a href="our-aura.html">aura</a></strong>, and how they are <em>affected</em> by <a href="healing-stones.html">stones</a> <em>especially</em>.<br><br>

							When I turned 24 I bought my first wire wrapping tool kit, and started doing single wire wraps around lovely stone specimens. As I worked, and as I saw other peoples work, I realized that the stones could look even more <strong>physically</strong> beautiful, and feel <em>energetically</em> stronger as I got better at wrapping and weaving wire around them. Which leads us to this day, I am now 26 and have helped find the right stone, and wrap, for <strong>100's</strong> of people!<br><br>

						 	Hopefully through this website I can <strong><em>help</em></strong> as many people as possible learn more about the effect stones have on our <a href="our-aura.html">aura</a>, and also help individuals find a little more harmony in their lives. <strong><em>I am not a doctor, and am not here to give medical advice</em></strong>, however, I have been helped by the stones around me, and wish the same for others. Hopefully together we can find the right stone, and wrap, for <strong><em>you</em></strong>!
